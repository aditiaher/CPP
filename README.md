# Some important points of OOP
# Classes in Cpp
    - Classes is the one of main key Component in object oriented programminh in c++
    - A class definition starts with the keyword class followed by the class name; and the class body,      enclosed by a pair of curly braces. 
    - The keyword public determines the access attributes of the members of the class that follows it.
    - In C++, there are three access specifiers:
            public - members are accessible from outside the class
            private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
            protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.
    - if we did not specify any access specifier in the class then by default all are private.
    - The difference between structure and class is that the members of the structure are by default public and members of class are by default private.
    - functions which are defined inside the class are inline functions.
# objects 
    - object is a instance of a class.
    - memory is allocated after creating the object of a particular class.
    - To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name.
    - To access the class attributes (myNum and myString), use the dot syntax (.) on the object:
